### Hi there 👋

I'm Yurii Gornichev

Web Developer and Html Coder from 
Ukraine, Kiev.


I was born and raised in Kyiv.⚡

Studied at the National Aviation University and have a master's degree.

I'll tell you a few words about the technology of my coding:

For writing I use the program Php Storm.
For styling I use the Saas processor.
For perfect display of the layout I take Perfect Pixel.
The dynamics of the site is set by the Java-Script code.
All work data is stored in a personal repository Git Hub.
The finished code is checked by W3C and PagesSpeed services.👨‍🎨


- 🔭  I’m currently working on creating an online clothing store for surfing and other water sports. "Wave Garmony"
- 🌱 I study under the guidance of a personal tutor + video tutorials and technical literature to improve my web skills
- 📫 if you have any questions you can write to me at gornichev1986@gmail.com.
